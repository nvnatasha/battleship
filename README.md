* Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would’ve approached the design and problem solving process.
	- For iteration 3, while there wasn’t a laid out interaction pattern, there is the flow of the game and how the game is supposed to work. So we laid that out. 
For instance, the game starts, how do we get it to start? What parameters are in this function?
Now, we have the game started, it’s time to play the game. What all entails playing the game? We need to place our ships, the computer needs to place its ships.
Our ships are placed, now we take our turns. Did our shot miss? Did it hit? Is a ship sunk? What do we need to write for all of these factors for our game to play?
Taking it step by step with how the game should flow is how we went about designing iteration 3. 


* If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
	- If there had been one more day to work on this project, it might’ve been more of a possibility to try to work on iteration 4, or at least see what could’ve been added to our game. See if there were any other function we could do that would make the game stand out a little bit more.


* Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
	- For the majority of this project, there was a lot of ping-pong efforts made, with pretty good conversation and communication in between it. We communicated a lot through slack on what we were working on, when pull requests were made, and when we might take turns putting work in while the other did take a break. 


* Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
	- Pretty much all of the feedback was shared directly. When pull requests were made, we typically would be on zoom and discuss what changes were implemented and why, or what did we add and what does the function do. We really tried to communicate as best as we could to work as efficiently as possible in order to best achieve our goal of this project once finished.
